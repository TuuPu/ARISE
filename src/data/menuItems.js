        <>
          <p>In this first iteration of the ARISE SSH framework, we propose to simultaneously test out the more general level principles set out in the Ethics by Design framework as well as the more HRI and Industry 5.0 specific ethics principles set out in the framework consolidated by Callari et al. Our goal is to simultaneously have a strong and empirically grounded backing from the Ethics by Design Principles that has been built up during previous Horizon projects, as well as take into account especially more worker related and human-centric aspects that are brought about by the 30 field specific ethics experts in the Delphi study by Callari et al. and consolidated under the framework and its related ethics principles and associated requirements. </p>
          <p>In practical terms, for the ARISE framework, this means consolidating the principles from both approaches and using the requirements listed from both in the interactions with the FSTP projects. We aim to test what works and what questions and requirements seem pertinent and iterate the ARISE framework’s principles and associated requirements further based on this feedback and experiences with the FSTP projects. As there is a major overlap between the two approaches – the more general one in the Ethics by Design approach and the HRI and Industry 5.0 specific one by Callieri et al., we propose to consolidate the principles as shown in this part of the website.</p>

        text: <p>Systematic evaluation of the potential impacts of proposed technologies and projects on ethical values or norms is to identify, predict and mitigate the unwanted ethical implications of the initiative. Within the ARISE SSH framework, the initial EIA is grounded on the SIENNA framework and the SATORI EIA process. It will be developed further based on initial findings from the ARISE project’s FSTP project phase. The initial ARISE EIA process is first tested with the first batch of the FSTP project in the second year of the project and iterated for the second round based on those experiences. The process will also be updated after the second batch in later stages of the project to capture insights and learnings on EIA, making it readily available for use in future projects. Next, we will describe the various groups related to the ARISE EIA and the six-stage process through which the assessment is conducted.</p>
